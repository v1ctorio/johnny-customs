# How much money to expect

The customs charges in Spain are calculated based on the value of the goods you are importing. The charges are calculated as follows:

- For goods with a value of up to 150€, you will not have to pay any customs charges.

- For goods with a value over 1500€ (unlikely for Hack Club), you will have to pay a 21% VAT and a 2.5% customs duty.
