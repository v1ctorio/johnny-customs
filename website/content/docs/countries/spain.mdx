Hack Club ships packages using Asendia. Then, when they reach Spain, they are handed over to Correos.

# How much money to expect

The customs charges in Spain are calculated based on the value of the goods you are importing. The charges are calculated as follows:

- For goods with a value of up to 150€, you will not have to pay any customs charges.
- For goods with a value between 150€ and 1500€, you will have to pay a 21% VAT.
- For goods with a value over 1500€ (unlikely for Hack Club), you will have to pay a 21% VAT and a 2.5% customs duty.

Unfortunately, customs agents mark packages as "Sale of Goods" instead of "Gift", so for larger packages that won't fit in an envelope, you will have to pay customs charges.

# How to pay

There are two ways to pay the customs charges.

### 1. Online

You can pay the customs charges online by going to the [Correos Aduanas website](https://www.correosaduanas.es).  
Enter the tracking number of your package and the amount of the customs charges will be shown.

### 2. Correos office

To pay the customs charges, you will need to go to the Correos office where your package is being held. You will need to bring the following documents:

- ID card
- Cash (credit cards aren't accepted!)
